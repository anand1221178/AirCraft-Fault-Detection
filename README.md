# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft Engine Fault Detection using PGMs

This project implements a **Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN)** integrated with a **Markov Random Field (MRF)** to detect early-stage faults in aircraft engines. The system processes noisy, discretized sensor data and distinguishes between mechanical degradation and sensor failures.

---

## üß† Core Ideas

- **DBN** captures temporal dependencies between engine subsystem health and sensor observations.
- **MRF** smooths inconsistent vibration readings from colocated sensors (Vib1/Vib2).
- **Sensor Health Modeling** enables robustness to sensor drift and failure.
- **Simulated Dataset** mimics five realistic operational scenarios:
  - Normal Operation
  - Oil Leak
  - Bearing Wear
  - EGT Sensor Failure
  - Vibration Sensor Failure
