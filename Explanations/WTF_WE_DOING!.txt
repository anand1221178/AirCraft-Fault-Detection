Okay, let's clear up the confusion. It's easy to get tangled when dealing with the data file, the model's internal parts, and the final goal.

Think of it like this:

The Real World (Simulated): You have an engine. Things happen to it (it runs normally, it leaks oil, a bearing wears out, a sensor breaks). You can only observe this engine through its Sensors.

The Sensor Readings (Your Raw Data): These are the raw numbers coming from the sensors (EGT_C, N2_PctRPM, OilPressure_PSI, Vib1_IPS, Vib2_IPS). They reflect what's happening, but might be noisy, have dropouts (NaNs), or be misleading if a sensor itself is broken.

Preparing the Data (Discretization): Raw numbers are often hard for models like this DBN to work with directly. You convert the raw numbers into simpler categories: 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'. This gives you the *_Discrete columns in your CSV.

The Detective (Your DBN Model): This is the smart system you are building. Its job is to be like a detective.

The Clues (Model Inputs): The detective (your DBN) only gets to see the discretized sensor readings:

EGT_C_Discrete

N2_PctRPM_Discrete

OilPressure_PSI_Discrete

Vib1_IPS_Discrete

Vib2_IPS_Discrete
These are the INPUT EVIDENCE fed into the model at each time step. The model never sees the raw values or the ground truth labels during prediction.

The Detective's Brain (Hidden States): Inside the DBN, the detective has ideas about what might be going on based on the clues. These are the HIDDEN STATES â€“ things the model tries to figure out but can't observe directly:

Engine_Core_Health (Is it OK, Warning, Failed?)

Lubrication_System_Health (Is it OK, Failed?)

EGT_Sensor_Health (Is the EGT sensor OK, Degraded, Failed?) - This is handled by the HMM part.

Vibration_Sensor_Health (Are the Vib sensors OK, Degraded, Failed?) - This is handled by the HMM part.

The Detective's Conclusion (Model Predictions): After looking at the sequence of clues (discrete sensor readings over time), the detective (DBN) gives its best guess about the hidden states. These are the OUTPUT PREDICTIONS:

The probability that Engine_Core_Health is 'OK', 'Warn', or 'Fail'.

The probability that Lubrication_System_Health is 'OK' or 'Fail'.

The probability that EGT_Sensor_Health is 'OK', 'Degraded', or 'Failed'.

The probability that Vibration_Sensor_Health is 'OK', 'Degraded', or 'Failed'.

Checking the Detective's Work (Evaluation): How do we know if the detective (DBN) is right? We compare its predictions to the GROUND TRUTH labels stored in your CSV file (which you created during simulation, so you know the actual answers):

Compare predicted Engine_Core_Health/Lubrication_System_Health probabilities (which imply a fault like 'Normal', 'OilLeak', 'BearingWear') against the Engine_Fault_State column.

Compare predicted EGT_Sensor_Health probabilities against the EGT_Sensor_Health column.

Compare predicted Vibration_Sensor_Health probabilities against the Vibration_Sensor_Health column.

Summary - What Are We Doing?

We USE: The discretized sensor readings (EGT_C_Discrete, N2_PctRPM_Discrete, OilPressure_PSI_Discrete, Vib1_IPS_Discrete, Vib2_IPS_Discrete) as INPUTS to the DBN model.

The Model PREDICTS: The probabilities of the hidden states (Engine_Core_Health, Lubrication_System_Health, EGT_Sensor_Health, Vibration_Sensor_Health).

We EVALUATE: By comparing the model's predictions against the ground truth labels (Engine_Fault_State, EGT_Sensor_Health, Vibration_Sensor_Health) that are stored in the CSV but NEVER shown to the model during prediction.

So, the DBN learns the relationship between the patterns in the (discrete) sensor readings and the likely underlying health states and sensor reliability states. It doesn't directly predict the "Scenario" name, but its predictions about the health states should correspond to the correct scenario.
